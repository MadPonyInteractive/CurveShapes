***Curve Shapes*** is a Blender extension that allows you to manipulate geometry with curves. It is a powerful tool that can be used to create complex shapes with ease. It offers several ways to create geometry from curves including 
* Curve shape from Blender curve
* Curve shape from Annotations
* And existing curve shape templates

### In blender, a Curve Shape is composed of 2 objects: 
* A curve object 
* A mesh object

The curve object is used to control the shape of the mesh object. 

This allows you to create complex shapes with ease using bezier curves.
